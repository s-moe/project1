Project title: 
"Pizza Delivery" is a game/story hybrid that helps you learn the importance of keeping your tank full of gas and getting a customer's order correct.

Win State:
Get $100 in tips (amount to be determined)
Or deliver all of the pizzas without getting fired

Lose State:
Run out of gas or get fired for delivering the wrong pizza too many times (3 warnings gets you fired).

Classes(do I need them for this?): 
- Driver/Car
- Customer - customer will tip the driver if they receive the correct pizza
    

Buttons: 
- Drive (decreases amount of fuel by random number); 
- Deliver (matches pizza ordered with pizza delivered) - if they match you get a tip, if they don't match up you get a warning; 
- Refuel (adds fuel to the car and reduces your tip amount); 
- Quit (quits the game); 
- Reset (Resets the game);

Display: 
- Tip amount: $ ; 
- Fuel gauge: (miles left in tank)
- Pizzas left to deliver:
